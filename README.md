Merge conflict practices 💐🐈‍⬛

`git branch`: lists all your current branches. The one you are on will have a * and be colored green

`git branch <NAME>`: this will create a branch where HEAD is

`git switch <NAME>`: moves over to the branch

`git log` --oneline: see where you are

`git push origin b1`: pushes the b1 branch to the remote

`git pull origin b1`: pull the b1 branch from the remote
